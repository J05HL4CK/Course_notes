Objects and Classes
=================
- OOP or object orientated programming is a model that organises software design around objects rather than logic

 - centred around the object and its attributes
 ## Principles of OOP
  1. Encapsulation
  1. Abstraction
  1. Inheritance
  1. Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

  Each object keeps its attributes or state private and controls which external entities can access attributes and how by providing methods 


## Abstraction
  
  Objects must always provide consistent high-level interface for interaction. keeping hidden th complexities of structure and workings.

## Inheritance
  
  Objects can be defined in a heirarchy. Parent objects encapsulate shared attributes and actions and child objects can differentiate where needed.

## Polymorphism

   Meaning many shapes in greek. Parent objects define actions (methods) and child objects can implement those named methods in different ways according to their nature. 

## Benefits of OOP

 - reusable code through inheritance
 - simple and clear interfaces throuch encapsulation
 - flexibility through polymorphism
